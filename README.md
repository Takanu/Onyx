## Onyx
Onyx is a series of custom, modular nodes that work together to help you keep your level designs out of a 3D modelling program and in Godot, letting you keep your designs dynamic and flexible throughout the development process.

Onyx nodes will be able to attach themselves to each other to augment the abilities of one node with another naturally, without leading to cumbersome property panel options.

This plugin is very early in development, in time ill provide additional documentation and usage guidelines.


### Roadmap
- OnyxShape - Lots of different CSG shape types with customisation and UV mapping options.

- OnyxSprinkler - Distribute nodes across custom volume areas, snapping to geometric detail in your scene.

- OnyxFence - Custom collision border system, easily fence off game areas.

- OnyxPlatform - Like CSGPolygon but with spline and curved corner support, as well as UV mapping options.

- OnyxPillar - Construct a chain of meshes that can be flexibly stretched and flexed, lets you build flexible architectural details and supports that can fit any situation.

- OnyxArray - Array-based distribution of other nodes.

- OnyxHammer - The "Punch a hole in anything" node.  Subtract CSG geometry, remove Sprinkler details, create a Fence hole, create a hole in array distribution, can remove anything from any Onyx node.

- OnyxRoad - Versatile road mapping with curve-based UV and road edge shape capabilities, auto-snapping and more.
