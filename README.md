## Onyx
Onyx is a Godot plugin that provides series of custom 3D level design tools that can be used to develop advanced level designs.  They leverage Godot's unique design strengths with the goal of keeping as much of the level design process in-engine where it is immediately interactable and testable.

The first set of tools included are a series of versatile Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) primitives you can use to block out levels.  Unlike the primitive shapes included with the engine, these let you customise far more shape parameters, offers better origin management and viewport handle controls, and comes with excellent UV mapping by default.

Other toolsets will be included in the future that all work together seamlessly, expanding the possibilities of 3D level design in Godot.

## Installation Instructions
- Create a folder called 'addons' in the main folder of your project.
- Drag 'onyx' into the addons folder.
- View all your currently available plugins by going to Project > Project Settings > Plugins.
- Activate Onyx by clicking on the Status dropdown and changing it to 'Active'.

Once done, all the extra nodes this plugin provides will be available for you to add in your scenes.
