## Onyx
Onyx is a series of custom 3D level design tools that can be used to develop advanced level designs, with the goal of keeping as much of the level design process in Godot where it is immediately interactable and testable.

The first set of tools included are a series of versatile Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) primitives you can use to block out levels.  Unlike the primitive shapes included with the engine, these let you customise far more shape parameters, offers better origin management and handles, and comes with excellent UV mapping by default.

As I keep developing this other toolsets will be introduced that can be layered upon each other quickly to create even more complex and production-ready level designs.

## Current Tools Included

### Onyx Set
7 CSG primitives for constructing level prototypes (Cube, RoundedCube, Cylinder, Sphere, Ramp, Wedge, Stairs).
(currently missing optional material slots, robust origin position settings)

## Future Toolsets

### Blueprint Set
Mark out, annotate and plan 3D spaces.

### Flex Set
Develop complex mesh and spatial assets that can be reused, stretched and re-sized intelligently.

### Adaptive Mesh Set
Transform pre-existing blocks with insets, stencils, arrays and more.

### Path Set
Complex array and pathing tools for barriers, roads and other structures.
